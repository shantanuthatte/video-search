<p>Our efforts in this project are to be able to perform semantic searches on video files.</p>

<p>To do this we needed to select a limited selection of videos in order to create a standardized pool. The group distributed this effort so that each group member was choosing 25 videos on Youtube of at least 5 minutes and no longer than 59 minutes and 59 seconds. The videos had to be predominately spoken.  We were then to run them through transcription software such as Google or Dragon.</p>

<p>The transcription will include various time-stamps throughout the videos. Our programmers will then run the text through an algorithm to create a frequency map of words. Looking for sections with peaks we will set a minimum value and use these peaks to define keywords.  The peaks will also act as section designators so that the keywords fall within the specific time span marked by the peak. The keyword collection will be used for the primary search method.</p>

<p>We plan to use either Indri or Sphider as the basic search tool and alter it as necessary to create the search environment we want.  We plan to have a search box that you can choose keyword or full text search option along with a list of keywords to choose from in case that will help you find what you are looking for.  This multi-interface option allows different search techniques to be satisfied within our single retrieval system.</p>
